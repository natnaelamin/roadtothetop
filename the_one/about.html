      <p>
        Christopher Maurice Brown (born May 5, 1989) is an American singer,
        songwriter, dancer, and actor. According to Billboard, Brown is one of
        the most successful R&B singers of his generation, having often been
        referred to by many contemporaries as the "King of R&B". His musical
        style has been defined as polyhedric, with his R&B being characterized
        by several influences from other genres, mainly hip hop and pop music.
        His lyrics develop predominantly over themes of sex, romance, fast life,
        desire, regret, and emotional conflict. Brown has gained a cult
        following and wide comparisons to Michael Jackson for his stage
        presence.
